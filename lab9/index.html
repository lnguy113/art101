					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This was the first lab that did not include in dept instructions of what to type for the program so it was slightly more challenging.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I kept running into errors while coding in the JavaScript file. I often referred to google to help me fix the problems that I kept getting.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this assignment was slightly confusing. Considering the fact that there was no like "this is what the output should look like" image, I am not entire sure if this assignment is correct. I put a lot of good energy into this project. </p>
