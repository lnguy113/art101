					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was definately really difficult for me. I ran into so many minor errors that made my results not print</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For some reason, I did not know how to find a way to print the result. I used the professor's website to see how he wrote his JavaScript file. I used the Hogwart's house description. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I spent a good amount of time on this lab. I was much harder than I had thought. However, with the resources that was avaiable to me, I was able to excuate this assignment pretty smoothly. The lab went pretty decently. I put good energy into this assignment, however I was getting slightly disappointed when my code would not print properly. </p>
