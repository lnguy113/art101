			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Whilst completing this lab, there wasn't exactly any tough challenges that I encounter. Based on the programming experiences that I have, I have worked with pseudocode before so this assignment was rather easy for me.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have any problems or challenges so there wasn't anything I specifically did to overcome them. Something that I spent some time on was actually coming up with an idea for my psuedocode that includes a computer task. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was actually pretty fun. I am currently programming a graph for my other class so this one really allowed me to step back and understand the foundations. The energy that went into this project is all positive.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code> 
Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task 
1. Create a list of high-level tasks
2. If necessary, break complicated task down into sub-steps
3. Put this in outline form
					  
high-level tasks 
- making coffee 
- deep cleaning the bathroom
- cooking pasta 
					  
sub-steps 
	making coffee 
	1. take out the coffee powder and scoop out a small amount into a seperate cup
	2. make some hot water
	3. once the water is hot, pour about 1/4 a cup into the cup with coffee powder 
	4. take a spoon and mix throughly
	5. add milk and creamer (amount may vary due to liking)
					  
Task 2: Pseudocode a computer task 
1. create a list of high-level tasks your computer program is going to have to do to be complete
2. keep it high level 
3. Break down complicated task into sub-tasks
					  
outline 
	creating an exam counter
	1. set pass, fails, student to either 0 or 1
	2. check the students score
	3. if less than passing number, add to fail
	4. if higher than passing number, add to pass
	5. prints final number
					  
Task 3: Turn pseudocode into comments

	// summary.
	// description. 
	// @link URL 
	// @file This file includes the psuedocode for my exam counter
	// @author Lily Nguyen

psuedocode: creating an exam counter
	// initalize pass to zero 
	// initalize fail to zero 
	// initalize students to one
	// while students counter is less than or equal to ten
	// input the next exam results 
	// if the students passed 
		/ add one to passes counter 
	// else 
		// add ones to fails counter
	// add one to student counter 
	// print the number of passes
	// print the number of fails
