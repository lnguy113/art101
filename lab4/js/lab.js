/* 
Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task 
  1. Create a list of high-level tasks
  2. If necessary, break complicated task down into sub-steps
  3. Put this in outline form

  high-level tasks 
  - making coffee 
  - deep cleaning the bathroom
  - cooking pasta 

  sub-steps 
    making coffee 
      1. take out the coffee powder and scoop out a small amount into a seperate cup
      2. make some hot water
      3. once the water is hot, pour about 1/4 a cup into the cup with coffee powder 
      4. take a spoon and mix throughly
      5. add milk and creamer (amount may vary due to liking)

Task 2: Pseudocode a computer task 
  1. create a list of high-level tasks your computer program is going to have to do to be complete
  2. keep it high level 
  3. Break down complicated task into sub-tasks

  outline 
    creating an exam counter
      1. set pass, fails, student to either 0 or 1
      2. check the students score
      3. if less than passing number, add to fail
      4. if higher than passing number, add to pass
      5. prints final number

Task 3: Turn pseudocode into comments

  psuedocode: creating an exam counter
    // initalize pass to zero 
    // initalize fail to zero 
    // initalize students to one
    // while students counter is less than or equal to ten
      // input the next exam results 
      // if the students passed 
        // add one to passes counter 
      // else 
        // add ones to fails counter
    // add one to student counter 
    // print the number of passes
    // print the number of fails
