					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with making my background change colors when the button was pressed on. I was able to just play around with the code to help me fix it. I also completed this lab during class when the professor was teaching the 'libraries and jQuery' lab so the information he was teaching really helped me.</p>
