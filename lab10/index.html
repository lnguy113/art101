					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Throughout this lab, I stuggled with the format of how to include the button onto the index.html file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Something was not right when I was coding in the javascript file because the format was correct however, it was not printing anything. I was able to play around with the code and was able to get it to work.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was rather simple once I was able to get the general gist but during the process, I had some minor struggles. The overall process was pretty good. I put good energy into this project.</p>
