					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Something that I struggled with during this lab is creating the folders within the folders.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When I was creating the lab folders, it did not let me create a new folders. I would just look like "Lab7 /css / img" instead of actually putting the folders I create inside the folders. I ended up creating a placeholder file inside the lab folder, then proceeded to create the other folder inside the lab folders. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After figuring out that slight problem with creating the folders, the steps after seem to be pretty easy. It went pretty easy after I got the hang of it. I think I put quite a bit of energy into this lab. Considering how self explantory this lab was, it took me about an hour or so to figure it out. </p>
